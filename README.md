## Discourse is Built With

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) &mdash; Our back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests RESTfully in JSON.
- [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) &mdash; Our front end is an Ember.js app that communicates with the Rails API.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) &mdash; Our main data store is in Postgres.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) &mdash; We use Redis as a cache and for transient data.
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) &mdash; We use BrowserStack to test on real devices and browsers.

Plus *lots* of Ruby Gems, a complete list of which is at [/main/Gemfile](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/main/Gemfile).
