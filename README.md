**[Timog BBS](https://timog.net)** is a message board for  [Filipinos in Japan](https://timog.net/t/filipinos-in-japan/974), a little corner of the Web where we can get together outside the gated walls of social media. Post a message, ask a question, talk about anything under the sun.

Timog BBS is powered by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org), an open source community platform.
